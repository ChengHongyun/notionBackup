# Recent Target

- Complete the code part of mixed log analysis
    - I need to coordinate with people in Huawei to get access to the log data
    - I need to have a basic idea of the design pattern based on the markdown XuLong have presented.
    - I need to figure out what parser to integrate, in other word, which parser is the best choice for our task
    - I need to write code in my mac and copy it to the Huawei laptop to run the code
- Find out a delicate and relatively well-modeled direction to start my own research
    - Several directions I have looked into:

    ## Done in this Week:
    
    - Mixed Log Analysis
        - [x]  Read papers about parser
        - [x]  run parsers to parser log data
        - [x]  understand the code according to the papers so I can integrate upon them
    - My research
        - [x]  read last 5 years accepted papers’ title in ICSE, FSE, ASE, ISSTA, TSE, EMNLP, ACL websites
        - [x]  find some directions that intrigued me, mostly focusing on automatic generation of natural language in software engineering, including auto commit generation, auto log generation, auto comment generation, function/class/method’s name generation and so on.
        - [x]  collect paper in the directions that I am interested with
        - [x]  read abstract and useful sections in these papers
        
    
    ## I Want to Discuss:
    
    - Is it OK that I choose direction differ from the main stream of our lab, which is AIOps and Testing? I will change my direction if u think it’s better that I focused on the main stream tasks in our group.
    - I would be grateful to hear your opinions of the direction I’ve chosen.
    - could u please give me some advice on explore a new direction?
