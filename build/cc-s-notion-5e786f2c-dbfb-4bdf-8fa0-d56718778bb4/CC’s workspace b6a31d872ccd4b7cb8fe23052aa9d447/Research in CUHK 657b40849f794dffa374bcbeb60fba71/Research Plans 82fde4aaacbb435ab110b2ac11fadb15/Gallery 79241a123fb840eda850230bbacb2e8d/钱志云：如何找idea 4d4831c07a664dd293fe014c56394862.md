# 钱志云：如何找idea

Created: September 17, 2022 2:56 PM

## One common misconception is you have to understand *all* the technical details of a paper to consider the job done.

a process of learning to appreciate and criticize research ideas, e.g., why is a paper good or bad? What makes an interesting paper? You don’t have to read every single detail of the paper to answer these questions.

## find what types of papers interest you the most and ask yourself why

- research styles
    - novel attacks and exploitation techniques, analysis of emerging systems or an algorithm, to defenses, measurements, and more
- research techniques
    - manual analysis, reverse engineering, program analysis, formal methods, hardware-based system design, data-driven approaches such as machine learning and AI

## ****Recognize patterns of developing research ideas****

- Read a few papers on a topic, jot down some notes about the differences among these papers in terms of assumptions, guarantees/properties offered by a system, methodologies, techniques, datasets, etc.
- draw a table (not necessarily 2-dimensional). Look for empty spots and those are potential new research ideas you can work on (in fact many good papers use such a table or figure to clearly distinguish themselves from related works).
    - One example is in the space of adversarial machine learning where many researchers have initially focused on images, e.g., how to perturb a picture of a cat so that it is misclassified as a banana. Soon other domains such as video, audio, and malware are investigated (e.g., how to fool a malware classifier by injecting meaningless instructions).
    - Another simple example is: people may have applied static analysis to automatically find certain types of vulnerabilities but no one has applied dynamic analysis yet.
    - there are also various types of static and dynamic analysis. You can make a much more fine-grained table which will give you more opportunities to identify the blanks
    - Similarly, if a certain type of vulnerability has been studied, you can potentially work on a different type.

## fill the blank

- The key to applying this pattern successfully is to map out the dimensions that exist in a space. The deeper you can go, the more likely you will find blanks to fill.
    - For example, you have to be familiar with the different kinds of program analysis techniques before you can draw a table and convince yourself that a specific technique has not been tried out to solve a problem. Similarly, you need to be aware of the different kinds of vulnerabilities (there are a dozen of memory corruption vulnerability types alone).
    1. read broadly and look for differences between papers on similar topics.
    2. read survey papers can potentially be a shortcut as it typically summarizes a space in a number of dimensions already

## expansion

if you already have some ideas in a space (e.g., published a paper or two), you can be in an advantageous position to see dimensions that are not obvious to others.

## build a hammer and find nails

- The high-level idea is that if you have a unique expertise, technique, system, or even dataset (that no one else can easily replicate), you can take advantage of it and use it to look for interesting problems to solve (we are lucky to have so many practical problems in computer science).
- His group built a strong expertise in virtual machines (among other things) and leveraged it to develop many interesting applications on top. If I remember correctly, Pete’s group built the world’s first full virtual machine record and replay capability. This has important applications for debugging, retroactive intrusion analysis. A number of top-quality papers (e.g., OSDI, ASPLOS, PLDI) are published on this topic with regard to determinism guarantees, performance, etc.
- It is really about building up the expertise in network side channels, which is admittedly a small area without too much competition. The nice thing about building up your expertise this way is that once you are so deep into a topic, it is much easier for you to find new problems to solve.
- few groups typically dominate a space. It is very difficult to surpass them unless you have a unique perspective. That said, if you are able to identify something where a lot of people need it but no good solution exists yet, it might be worth considering.

## start small, then generalize

- Oftentimes a research idea starts with a small observation. After some digging, you can see if it can be developed into a full idea worth publishing.
- it can be tricky to determine whether to pursue it and how much time you should spend digging before giving up.
    - The initial observation (however small) is so intriguing and surprising when you first saw it.
    - When you dig deeper, you realize that the phenomenon is rooted in something fundamental and cannot be explained easily by well-known concepts (e.g., a novel design flaw that leads to security vulnerabilities)
    - The observation is unlikely to be one-off, e.g., there is a bigger space behind and there are many other similar situations that you can investigate.

## reproduction of prior work

(1) inadvertent mistakes made by the authors

(2) some results being not 100% reproducible by design, e.g., measurement of some Internet phenomenon which changes over time. 

(3) biased benchmarks or datasets picked which favored a method proposed in a paper.

- If you are able to identify important discrepancies or limitations of prior work, it often means room for improvement. Even if you manage to reproduce the work 100% as expected, there can often be other insights or side discoveries that were not mentioned in the paper along the way (there is only so much space in a paper).

## external sources: from industry, news feed, etc.

- Take opportunities to connect to industry people, learn their pressing needs and pain points.
- regularly use Twitter as their tech news feed.

## ****Develop a good habit of thinking about research ideas****

- Keep reading some papers periodically, e.g., when a new batch of papers comes out from a conference. The least you can do is to scan through all the paper titles. Read the abstract of a few papers that sound interesting. Then read more carefully if they are *actually* interesting to you (this goes back to your research taste). Make sure you pay attention to research ideas in these papers (not just the technical side of things).
- Take paper reviews seriously. Advisors often offload paper reviews to students and then discuss these papers with students. This is a great chance to learn “how the sausage is made”. Normally you will read only published papers with good novelty and impact (also well written). During paper reviews though, you get to see rejected papers and learn why they are considered below the bar.
- In practical fields of computer science (e.g., systems, networking, security, software engineering), we are at a point where each individual field has been more and more mature to the point where many good ideas come from crossovers of different fields.
- 组会：try to read the paper to-be-discussed ahead of time to gain an advantage.
    - Once you start doing this once or twice and feeling rewarded (being able to have a good discussion), you will become more and more comfortable over time！！！
    - having a debate on whether an idea is good (even if it is already published in a good conference). Some students play an attacker role looking for weaknesses and limitations, and the others try to defend the paper.
- One way to set up a conducive environment is to periodically talk to them and ask them about how their project is going and volunteer your genuine feedback.
    - Talking to others can give you a fresh perspective helping you out (I have certainly benefited from it myself).
