<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

</aside>

# create a class

use the keywordÂ `class`:

---

# create a object

use the class to create object

---

# The __init__() Function

All classes have a function called **init**(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

Use the **init**() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created

---

# self

TheÂ `self`parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.

It does not have to be namedÂ `self`, you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:

---

# instance

Instance refers to Reference of an object. Object is actually pointing to memory address of that instance.

---

# Modify Object Properties

p1.age = 40

---

# **Delete Object Properties**

using theÂ `del`Â keyword:

del p1.age

---

# **Delete Objects**

using theÂ `del`Â keyword:

del p1

---

# pass

`class`definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have aÂ `class`
Â definition with no content, put in theÂ `pass`Â statement to avoid getting an error.

---

# none

TheÂ `None`Â keyword is used to define a null value, or no value at all.

None is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string. None is a data type of its own (NoneType) and only None can be None.

---

# assert

TheÂ `assert`Â keyword is used when debugging code.

TheÂ `assert`Â keyword lets you test if a condition in your code returns True, if not, the program will raise an AssertionError.
