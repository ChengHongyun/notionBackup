# NotionDown GetTokenV2

**There are a couple of Notion hacks that I can think of off the top of my head that require a Notion Token v2. The first, is required in order to create a Notion-based website and the other to use [Chilipepper](https://chilipepper.io/), a form embed for Notion. Here is how to find your v2 token.**

## **STEP 1**

Use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and sign into your Notion workspace.

## **STEP 2**

Right click anywhere inside the page and select "Inspect."

## **STEP 3**

Locate "Application" and select "Cookies." Here you should be able to find "token_v2." Copy the property next to it called "Value."
